> The bean machine, also known as the Galton Board or quincunx, is a device invented
by Sir Francis Galton to demonstrate the central limit theorem, in particular that the normal
distribution is approximate to the binomial distribution. Among its applications, it afforded
insight into regression to the mean or "regression to mediocrity".
